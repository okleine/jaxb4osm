## JAXB for OpenStreetMap

The tools are for marshalling and and (mostly) unmarshalling of  map.osm files from http://www.openstreetmap.org. To the best of my knowledge there is no XSD to define the structure of the downloadble XML-files. Thus, the JAXB compliant classes are not created via XJC but manually.
